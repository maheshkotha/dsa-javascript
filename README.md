# Data Structure
- A data structure is specific way of organizing, storing, and accessing data.

# Algorithm
- A set of instructions that tells a computer how to do something, or you can 
also say step-by-step solutionn of the problem is called algorithm



* How can we tell if the code we just wrote is GOOD CODE?

 - Big 'O'  -- Time Complexity 

    - how long --> Time Complexity
    - how much --> Space Complexity
    
    - Big O notation helps us understand how long an algorithm will take to run 
    or how much memory it will need as the amount of data it handles grows.

# Time Complexity
- O(n)
    - iterate over all elements

- O(1)
    - O(1) aka constant time, signifies that the execution time of an algorithm remains
  constant regardless of input size.

- O(n^2)
    - Indicates that the algorithm's execution time grows quadratically with the size 
      of the input data (represented by n)

- O(log n)
    - O(log n) time complexity refers to an algorithm's runtime that grows logarithmically
    with the size of the input (represented by n). In simpler terms, as the input size increases, the time it takes for the algorithms to run increses slowly.
